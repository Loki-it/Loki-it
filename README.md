Welcome to my GitHub portfolio.

Here you'll find an overview of my work, technical experience, and passion for development. However, many of my most complete and significant projects are not publicly available.
This is not a random decision. It is a conscious and necessary choice.

Over time, I’ve witnessed a widespread and unfortunate trend: companies and individuals extracting code from public repositories (often completely disregarding usage licenses) and repurposing it in paid commercial services, without giving any credit to the original developers or acknowledging the value of the work they’ve reused.

This is a modern form of intellectual theft which, although often ignored or downplayed, deeply undermines respect for creativity, skill, and the time invested by passionate developers.

I strongly believe in the value of open-source contributions, but also in the right to decide how, when, and with whom to share one's work.
My code is more than lines of logic. It is the result of hours of planning, experimentation, mistakes, optimization, and care.
For this reason, I choose not to make it publicly or freely available, especially when it can be exploited for profit without involving or crediting me in any way.

> "I believe in sharing, but not in giving away value to those who don’t respect it."

If you're genuinely interested in one of my projects, recognize its value, and wish to discuss a collaboration, licensing, or custom development, feel free to reach out.
I'm always open to constructive and professional conversations.

Thank you for visiting my profile and for the respect you’ve shown by reading this far.
